# ðŸ“– About LC Scripts

## **Hello World! ðŸ‘‹**

We're **LC Scripts**, we design and create things that we find missing in the FiveM scripting world. We make unique, cool and flawless scripts that makes your life owning/developing a server just a little better every single day. ðŸ‘Œ

if you haven't figured it out, LC stands for "Lazyllama Cyber". We are two developers making a bit of everything. We mostly go by [LCHoldings](https://lcholdings.net) and you can find us in many games or services doing many different things and we are both based out of **Sweden**. â˜•

[Lazyllama](https://lazyllama.xyz) is the frontend developer, mainly designing unique interfaces and making sure the visual aspect of every script is the best it can. Most graphics such as logos, banners, icons and such are probably thanks to him. ðŸŽ¨

[Cyber](https://github.com/cyberdev-tech) is the backend developer, he makes sure that the UI actually does something rather than look cool and existing. He makes sure the scripts always work, is updated and is as optimized as it can be. Without him there would be much of anything. ðŸ’»
